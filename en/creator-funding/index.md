Hey!

Creators giving a chance to our products is the main way we've grown this business.

We owe everything to them.

If you are a resin 3D printing creator with at least a small following, we'd love to hear from you too.

We are always looking for more creators to fund.

We will not meddle with your content, you can make whatever you want and say whatever you want.

We just want to help you create it.

If you think our resin is crap, you can say that too.

People should know about it.

<br />

## Project funding

**We want to help fund videos or projects that can include our resin in some way.**

Funding can mean resin of course, but we can also pay for other expenses, like art supplies, shipping costs, travel etc

(Within reason though, we're not rich.)

We're open to anything, but we espcially love these types of projects:

-   reviewing our products honestly (by itself or comparing it to competitors)
-   creating someting new, unique or beautiful
-   testing scientific/engineering ideas
-   [making something for someone else](https://yesthats3dprinted.com/pages/msfse-2024)

[Contact us](mailto:info@yesthats3dprinted.eu) to tell us your idea.

<br />

## Ongoing resin funding

If you'd like to use our resin on an ongoing basis as a creator, we'd like to make it available to you for free.

The gist is:

**Every time you make a post featuring our resin, we send you some more.**

We usually make some sales when creators post about us, so it's only fair.

The amount of material we can send you is based on your average reach, and how much you talk about our resin in a given post.

How well the actual post mentioning us performs doesn't matter.

Sometimes it will do well, somtimes it won't, it's okay.

We want to appreciate your effort, not the outcome.

Below you can see the breakdown for Youtube and Instagram. If you use some other platform, we can work out what numbers would make sense there.

If you might like to do this, [contact us](mailto:info@yesthats3dprinted.eu) so we can see if you're a good fit.

We're looking for creators that are highly specific to our target audience (eg. "3D printed doll artists" are more relevant than "doll artists")

As a guideline, we would expect no more than two pieces of content per month that features our resin (ie. content we can fund). If you'd like to do more, please give us a heads up.

### Example of promiment feature:

> Got the new Wargamer resin by FauxHammer. It's meant to be perfectly balanced for miniatures, let's see if it's true.

### Example of non-promiment feature:

> Printed a bunch of tanks for my army, can't wait to try out the new painting technique I learned at the painting workshop!! Printed using Wargamer resin.
