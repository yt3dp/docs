**Post-cure for ~5 minutes using UV light.**

Shorter curing times will leave the prints more flexible.

Longer curing times will make the prints stronger, but also more rigid.

5 minutes usually gives a good balance between the two, but you can vary this based on your equipment and preferences. 1 minute should be minimum for safety.

After curing, it should now be safe to touch the part with your bare hands.
