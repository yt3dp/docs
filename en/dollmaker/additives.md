You might want to add extra pigments or glitter etc to your resin to make your doll more unique.

This works well with DOLLMAKER resin, but it can make printing a bit more tricky, so we’d recommend to print a regular doll first before trying this.

If you do mix anything in, make sure to note down the ratios you use VERY EXACTLY (eg 10 drops of red pigment and 2 drops of blue added to 1 full bottle of resin). Otherwise you might not be able to recreate the same colour if you ever need to print it again.

**Your “normal exposure time” is likely to change whenever anything is added. Make sure to validate it with an exposure test whenever you create a different mix.**

You can also try mixing in other resins to attain a certain colour, but this might take away from DOLLMAKER's anti-scratch property and easy sandability.
