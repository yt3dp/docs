Shake the bottle or stir it inside the vat.</p><p>This applies even if you're just printing with the printer's 'vat clean' function.</p><p>Some ingredients inside the resin naturally settle to the bottom, like bits in orange juice. Mixing the resin makes the material uniform again, which is optimal for printing.</p><p>Shaking will usually create some bubbles inside the resin. Wait a few minutes until these have dissipated before starting your print.</p></div><div class="sd-card" target="_self"><figure><img src="https://app.snazzydocs.com/storage/users/Xniulla7ZiAZCeM4/docs/7VBCcNUP9ajJfVFv/images/CoblqudtGTwCNcE2UJYP.webp"></figure><p><br></p></div></div>
