You can copy these into your slicer, and forget about them if you’d like. Most of them only serve to make printing faster or troubleshoot if something goes wrong.</p><figure><img src="https://github.com/yt3dp/docs/raw/main/images/8Rhy2dr6Mjf5FCvvRnPV.webp"></figure><p><br></p><p>The only setting we always recommend dialling in is “normal exposure time,” using an exposure test like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.printables.com/model/229429-photonsters-validation-matrix-v2" target="_blank">Validation Matrix</a>. (Note: If using this exact one, your bottom layers must add up to 0.2mm.

<div class="sd-grid" data-columns="2"><div class="sd-card" target="_self"><h2>Supports</h2><p>We always recommend using very dense lightweight supports. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/resinprinting/comments/wzrat8/using_lightweight_but_dense_supports_for_resin/" target="_blank">example</a>)</p><p>Packing them so densely allows you to set support penetration depth as low as 0.</p><p>This results in supports that hold the model well, counteract warping, are very easy to remove, and leave minimal scarring.</p></div><div class="sd-card" target="_self"><h2>Hollowing and drain holes</h2><p>Large models should be hollowed. This reduces print failures, and uses much less resin.</p><p>Hollow models need <a href="https://youtu.be/yqDk5GFbop0" target="_blank">good drain holes</a>.</p><p>Hollow models should be washed on the inside too (eg. with a syringe) and cured on the inside too (<a href="https://youtu.be/dqJSJJGyak4" target="_blank">DIY method</a> or <a href="https://phrozen3d.com/products/cure-beam-post-curing-uv-pen" target="_blank">product</a>)</p></div></div>
