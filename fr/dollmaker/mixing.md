**Always mix your resin before use. Shake the bottle or stir it inside the vat.**

This applies even if you're just printing with the printer's 'vat clean' function.

Some ingredients inside the resin naturally settle to the bottom, like bits in orange juice. Mixing the resin makes the material uniform again, which is optimal for printing.

If you used any additives, proper mixing is even more important. If you have a long print running (over 4 hours), it is best to give the resin a stir midway through the print too.

Shaking will usually create some bubbles inside the resin. Wait a few minutes until these have dissipated before starting your print.
