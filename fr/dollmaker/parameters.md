**Create a new resin profile for DOLLMAKER in your slicer.**

We wish we could just give you the best and fastest settings based on your printer model, but annoyingly, the ‘perfect’ settings vary by individual machine, rather than make and model. Small variations like FEP tightness, UV strength, room temp etc all affect it.

Instead we want to recommend some safe base settings that will work well on pretty much any printer. You can copy these into your slicer, and forget about them if you’d like. Most of them only serve to make printing faster or troubleshoot if something goes wrong.

The only setting we always recommend dialling in is “normal exposure time,” using an exposure test like the [Validation Matrix](https://www.printables.com/model/229429-photonsters-validation-matrix-v2). (Note: If using this exact one, your bottom layers must add up to 0.2mm. Eg. 4 for 0.05mm layer height)

If you're new to printing, and you have no idea what we're talking about, you can learn more in this [FauxHammer video](https://youtu.be/Gm0-z971tgY).

If you'd like some more guidance, or want help reading an exposure test, just [contact us](mailto:info@yesthats3dprinted.eu). We're honestly happy to help.
