**Finished prints should be kept away from moisture and strong UV light.**

**Liquid resin must be shielded from air, UV light and humidity.**

If leftover resin in your vat will not be used again for over 24 hours, it is best practice to pour it into an air- and light-proof container.

This can be the original resin bottle, but if the resin in the vat is contaminated somehow, it will also contaminate any fresh resin you had left. It's best to use a filter when pouring. Keep the bottles in a cool, dry place away from sunlight.
