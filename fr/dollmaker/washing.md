**Use your preferred cleaning fluid to wash the prints. (eg isopropyl alcohol/IPA, denatured alcohol/methylated spirits, resin detergent. Water is not suitable.)**

â€ŽYou can use a dedicated wash unit, or just dunk and rinse in plastic tubs filled with alcohol.

**Use at least two stages of cleaning.** This means pre-rinse most of the dirt first in a tub, then do a proper wash in clean IPA in a second tub or wash station. Three stages (rinse, rinse, wash) is even better. ([example workflow](https://youtu.be/oCgDm1KfboY?t=86))

The total wash time does not need to be too long. You are only removing leftover resin from the surface, not washing the print itself, like a fabric. 1-5 minutes should normally be enough for a piece.

Make sure to clean hollow prints on the inside too.

Do not touch the prints with bare hands until post-curing is done.
