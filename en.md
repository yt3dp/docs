# WARGAMER

## Parameters

> üìç Create a new resin profile for WARGAMER in your slicer.

<!-- panels:start -->

<!-- div:left-panel -->
We wish we could just give you the perfect settings based on your printer model, but annoyingly there is almost as much variance between individual units as there is between different models, due to factors like FEP tightness, UV strength, room temp etc.

Instead we want to recommend some safe base settings that will work well on pretty much any printer. You can copy these into your slicer, and forget about them if you‚Äôd like. Most of them only serve to make printing faster or troubleshoot if something goes wrong.

The only setting we always recommend dialling in is **normal exposure time**, using an exposure test like the [Validation Matrix](https://www.printables.com/model/229429-photonsters-validation-matrix-v2) (Note: If using this exact one, your bottom layers must add up to 0.2mm. Eg. 4 for 0.05mm layer height)

We recommend against pass/fail exposure tests like the Cones of Calibrations as they can lead to inconsistent results with flexible resins like Wargamer.

If you're new to printing, and you have no idea what we're talking about, you can learn more in this [FauxHammer video](https://youtu.be/Gm0-z971tgY).

If you'd like some more guidance, or want help reading an exposure test, just [contact us](mailto:info@yesthats3dprinted.eu). We're honestly happy to help.

### Supports

We always recommend using very dense lightweight supports ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/resinprinting/comments/wzrat8/using_lightweight_but_dense_supports_for_resin/)).

Packing them so densely allows you to set support penetration depth as low as 0.

This results in supports that hold the model well, counteract warping, are very easy to remove, and leave minimal scarring.

### Hollowing and Drain Holes

Large models should be hollowed. This reduces print failures, and uses much less resin.

Hollow models need [good drain holes](https://youtu.be/yqDk5GFbop0).

Hollow models should be washed on the inside too (e.g., with a syringe) and cured on the inside too ([DIY method](https://youtu.be/dqJSJJGyak4) or [product](https://phrozen3d.com/products/cure-beam-post-curing-uv-pen)).

## PPE

<!-- panels:start -->
<!-- div:left-panel -->
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Always wear appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) when handling resin.**

This includes:
- nitrile gloves
- safety goggles
- respirator
- long sleeves and trousers

## Temperature
<!-- panels:start -->

<!-- div:left-panel -->

Wargamer is intended to be used at temperatures between 20‚Äì35¬∞C.

If your ambient temperature is significantly lower than this, consider using a heating method.

You can read more about temperature on [our blog](https://yesthats3dprinted.com/blogs/the-science-of-resin-printing/how-temperature-affects-resin-printing-the-science-of-resin-printing).

## Mixing
<!-- panels:start -->

<!-- div:left-panel -->

Always mix your resin before use. Shake the bottle or stir it inside the vat.

This applies even if you're just printing with the printer's 'vat clean' function.

Some ingredients inside the resin naturally settle to the bottom, like bits in orange juice. Mixing the resin makes the material uniform again, which is optimal for printing.

Shaking will usually create some bubbles inside the resin. Wait a few minutes until these have dissipated before starting your print.
