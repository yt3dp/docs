# ðŸŒŸ Awesome Prints Guarantee ðŸŒŸ

We know that people don't want a bottle of resin, they want the awesome prints that come from it.

Because of this, we're implementing two satisfaction guarantees:

1.  If you're not happy with Wargamer, just [message us](mailto:info@yesthats3dprinted.eu), and we'll give your money back.
2.  If you had a print failure, you can [send us](mailto:info@yesthats3dprinted.eu) a picture of it, and we'll refund any amount of resin you lost.

## Money-Back Guarantee

We only want to profit when we can make people happy.

We truly believe Wargamer is a great product, that makes better quality miniatures than generic 3D resins.

We're very proud to be selling something that has given value to hundreds of hobbyists, artists and professionals, that many call their "favourite resin".

That's how we want to make our money, by bringing genuine value to people.

But for every hundred happy users, there will inevitably be a few that we fail to impress.

If that's you, please just [send us](mailto:info@yesthats3dprinted.eu) a message, and we'll refund your purchase.

A few terms to this:

1.  You don't need any justification for the refund, just the fact that you didn't like it is enough. But we would really appreciate any feedback you have about the resin.
2.  If you had problems printing with the resin, we would like to help you solve it, in addition to sending you a new bottle/refunding the wasted amount.
3.  This guarantee would apply only for the first bottle in your order, which should be enough to decide if you liked it or not. If you ordered more than 1KG, we would ask that you return the rest (eg. return 4KGs if you ordered 5KGs). We'll pay for any return costs.
4.  Be nice. If we have reason to suspect fraud (eg. many requests from the same address) we reserve the right to refuse a refund. We'd like to keep this system alive, please don't ruin it for others.

## Anti-Fail Guarantee

If you're happy with Wargamer, but had a print failure, we'd like to refund the amount you wasted or send you a new bottle.

Even if it was your own mistake, we're happy to refund you. We'd just like to make sure you end up with great prints when buying Wargamer.

A few terms to this:

1.  We will ask you to please send us a picture of the failures.
2.  We also need some way to verify the amount of resin wasted. This can be a picture of the fails being weighed on a scale.
3.  Alternatively, you can send a screenshot of the slicer's estimation of the amount of resin that was used (example above). If you're not sure how to check this, we can help you.
4.  The refund amount will be based on how much resin you've lost. If the amount is substantial, we might offer to send you a whole new bottle instead.
5.  Be nice. If we have reason to suspect fraud (eg. many requests from the same address) we reserve the right to refuse a refund. We'd like to keep this system alive, please don't ruin it for others.
