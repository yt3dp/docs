The water inside gets 'muddy' immediately, and will not clean as well. A spray also creates much less wastewater.</li><li><strong>The print needs to be bone dry before curing.</strong> If it feels overly sticky, it is most likely still wet. See below for drying.

<div class="sd-grid" data-columns="1"><div class="sd-card" target="_self"><h2>Dealing with dirty water/IPA</h2><p><strong>Any liquid mixed with resin is toxic.</strong></p><p>Do not touch it with bare hands, and do not wash it down a drain.</p><p>Water can only be used once for cleaning. IPA can be reused many times, but it will eventually be too cloudy to use.</p><p>The contaminated water/IPA needs to evaporate, leaving just resin behind. This is best done by leaving the mix outside in the sun in a wide tray/container.</p><p>The water/IPA will evaporate, while the sun's UV rays will cure any leftover resin on the bottom. The cured resin can be safely thrown away.</p><p>If leaving it outside is not an option, putting a fan in front of the container is a cheap way to speed up evaporation. Any leftover resin can also be cured with a UV light.</p></div></div>
