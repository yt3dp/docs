**Dry your prints thoroughly before curing.**

Prints that are still wet might come out sticky to the touch.

You can use an active drying method like a hair dryer (on low heat) to speed up the process, or just let them air dry.

Air drying can take anywhere from a few minutes to a couple hours. It depends on your ambient humidity, the geometry of the part, how long you washed it for etc.

If the part feels dry, and only minimally tacky, it's probably dry enough.
