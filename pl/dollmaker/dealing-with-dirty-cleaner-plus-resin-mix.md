**Any liquid mixed with resin is toxic. Do not touch it with bare hands, and do not wash it down a drain.**

Alcohol can be reused many times for cleaning, but it will eventually become too cloudy to use.

To dispose of it, the cleaner needs to evaporated, leaving just resin behind. This is best done by leaving the mix outside in the sun in a wide tray/container.

The cleaner will evaporate, while the sun's UV rays will cure any leftover resin on the bottom. The cured resin can be safely thrown away.

If leaving the dirty mix outside is not an option, putting a fan in front of the container is a cheap way to speed up evaporation. Any leftover resin can also be cured with a UV light.

Alternatively, you may take the mix to a waste disposal facility in your area.
