We always recommend using very dense lightweight supports. ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/resinprinting/comments/wzrat8/using_lightweight_but_dense_supports_for_resin/))

Packing them so densely allows you to set support penetration depth as low as 0.

This results in supports that hold the model well, counteract warping, are very easy to remove, and leave minimal scarring.

Place supports on the inside of dolls wherever possible, to avoid support marks on visible outer surfaces.
