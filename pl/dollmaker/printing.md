**Pour in carefully, and start your print.**

Do not leave the resin bottle open for too long. Extended exposure to air and light deteriorates the material.

If you need to add more resin to the vat, make sure this is the same temperature as what is already inside.

Once printing is finished, it is best practice to retrieve the part as soon as possible. If left for a long time, it could start soaking humidity from the air around it.
